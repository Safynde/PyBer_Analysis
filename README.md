# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis
The analysis aims to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using python, Matplotlib, and Pandas. The data summarized how data differ by the city to help the V. Isualize make data-driven decisions. There are three types of town: rural, suburban and urban. This project includes 2,375 rides and 68,709 drivers for a total fare of $ 63,538.64.
# Results 
Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 (68.4% of the total rides) rides in urban cities, 625 (26.3% of total rides) rides in suburban towns, and 125(5.3% of the total rides) rides in the rural towns. For the same time frame, there were 2,405 (86.7% of total drivers) drivers in urban towns, 490 (12.5% of total drivers) drivers in suburban cities, and 78 (0.8% of total drivers) drivers in rural towns.

The total fares are higher in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities. The PyBer total transactions in urban cities are around $40,000 (62.7% of the total fares). The total transactions in urban cities are around $19,000 (30.5% of total fares). The total transactions in rural cities are about $4,000, respectively. The average fare per ride is $35 in rural cities, while the average fare per ride is $25 in urban cities. Suburban cities' average fare per ride is $31. The average fare per driver is $55 in rural cities, while the average fare per driver is $17 in urban cities. The suburban cities' average fare per driver is $40.
The multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" visualizes the PyBer Summary DataFrame.

The chart provides trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019. The yellow trend shows how fares in urban cities vary between $1,600 to $2,500 for these five months. The blue trend shows fares in rural cities which vary during the same period. The orange trend shows how the total fares in suburban cities vary between $700 to $1,300 during the same period. The peak in total fares in urban cities is toward the end of February, and another peak occurs toward the end of the first week of March.  The peak in total fares in suburban cities happened toward the end of February 2019. The peak in total fares in rural cities occurred toward the end of April.
# Summary
The rural town accounts for 6.8% of the company’s total revenue, although the average fare per ride is higher than in suburban and urban cities.  PyBer ridesharing services differ significantly in rural, suburban, and urban cities, given the number of rides, drivers, and fares. Ridesharing is a service that arranges one-way transportation on short notice. The three business recommendations are: 
•	PyBer needs to conduct a market analysis in the rural area better to understand the market and driving factors and understand average fare's  gap per driver which is 11 times higher in the ruarl area compared to the urban areas.
•	Research and test the pay per mile between rural, suburban, and urban cities and what are the driving factors of the fare in this case.
•	Increase the fare in urban cities and match at least the fare of the rural areas because the cost of living is too high in the urban cities.
